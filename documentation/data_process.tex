\section*{Data Collection & Processing}

\subsection*{Data Collection}
PhoneLab data including battery and screen information of more than 175 users from years 2014 and 2015
are processed and used for this project. Battery information is logged by the device every time battery
manager intent is broadcasted by the battery manager due to some change in the system such as change in
battery level, device being plugged in or taken off the plug, screen is being turned on or off. This data
is logged in as json object and the datadump received from PhoneLab is processed in steps using custom python
libraries, logic and design of which is explained in details in the next sub-section.


\subsection*{Data Processing}
The initial data dump is of size 16 GB.
