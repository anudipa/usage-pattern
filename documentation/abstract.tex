\section*{Abstract}
Energy management is a well researched problem for mobile systems. Considerable body of work has been
done to sense or collect battery information, mechanisms are build to manage energy consumption etc.
But fact remains that we still have minimal insight about how users are likely to use these personal
mobile systems or on which basis should an energy manager decide how to control energy consumed or 
what energy goals need to be set. An ideal scenario is to have a system which can model the energy behavior
of any user and can either do forecast or set most suitable energy goals for the user, to name few
applications of such a model. The aim of this proposed system is to use non intrusive/ non private
data to build an energy consumption model that can forecast accurately how likely the device will
reach low battery in future quite early in any discharging session. This information is valuable
because it can help user to plan their day better or aid energy management policies to take effective
decisions. Data collected from PhoneLab testbed spanning over multiple months and users is used to
build and train this system.
